# ALS318A_Adapter
ALS318A to 2x 2364AS adapter for KIM Uno

This board allows to use a Russian ALS318A display to be used with the KIM Uno. It connects the 17-pin connector to a dual 2364AS footprint matching the KIM Uno board.
As the ALS318A is a common cathode type display, the KIM Uno software needs to be adjusted for use with CC displays, too.

Footprint position has been checked against the original KIM Uno board. 
Board outline may still be too large. Please check before ordering.
