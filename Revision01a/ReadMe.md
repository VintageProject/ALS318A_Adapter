ALS318A to 2x 2364AS adapter for KIM Uno

This board allows to use a Russian ALS318A display to be used with the KIM Uno. It connects the 17-pin connector to a dual 2364AS footprint matching the KIM Uno board. As the ALS318A is a common cathode type display, the KIM Uno software needs to be adjusted for use with CC displays, too.

Footprint position has been checked against the original KIM Uno board. Board outline has been changed so that the adapter board has roughly the size of the ALS318A module. When soldering take care to leave enough room between the header pins and the Arduino pins.
Pin spacing has been changed to 2.5 mm for the ALS318A, and position was adjusted to centred.
